This repository contains a very tailor-made exercise to showcase the benefits and possible applications of the NSO in Docker (NID) project.

The following are the files included in the repository:

- ```nid_fundamentals.ipynb```: Notebook with a super brief introduction to the ```dev``` and ```base``` NSO image flavors.
- ```nid_skeletons.ipynb```: Notebook with a brief tutorial regarding the usage of the ```ned```, ```package``` and ```system``` skeleton flavours. A fairly feasible approach for a bash-based CICD pipeline.
